# CHIP-8
A CHIP-8 emulator written in Python3 under the MIT license.

# Requirements
These noted versions were used in development, older versions might work as well but weren't tested.

        Python 3.4
        Pyglet 1.2.4

# Usage
        python3 chip8.py <path_to_game>

# Keyboard
The key layout is not really ideal for a normal computer keyboard because the actions keys differ per game. There are 16 inputs in total which are set on: '0' to '9' and 'A' to 'F'.

# Todo
Sounds are not yet implemented - it will just say "beep". It would also be great if the keyboard input could be improved in such a way that movement and/or directional actions are mapped to WASD or something more intuitive - an option could be to make presets for different games.
